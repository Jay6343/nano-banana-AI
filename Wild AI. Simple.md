An ingenious method

Today, I‚Äôm excited to share 8 truly next-level ways to use Nano Banana.

1. Virtual fitting

Prompt: place the outfit in image 2 on the woman in image 1.

It can all be used online to create your own cosplay‚Ä¶

And it also supports trying on outfits with additional accessories.

2. Product Contextual Display

Prompt: Place image 2 into the woman‚Äôs hand in image 1.

It can seamlessly merge any two‚Äîor even multiple‚Äîunrelated images.

This feature represents a commercial-grade application of character consistency and multi-image fusion.

Lighting, reflections, and environmental colors are all automatically handled by the AI, producing results that often look more natural than many professionally retouched images.

Some users even tested extreme cases on Twitter, merging up to 13 objects in a single image.

3. Add post-production effects

Prompt: Set the car on fire.

You can observe that the details of the flames and smoke closely follow the laws of physics.

When combined with AI video models, this enables the direct generation of a wide range of cinematic visual effects.

4. Generate a 3D miniature building

Prompt: Turn this photograph of a building into an isometric tile, in the style of the five other 3D rendered images.
By providing five reference images here, the system can automatically extract detailed information about the subject.

It can be used to generate stylized, charming architecture‚Äîperfect for modeling into miniature cities.

5.Edit photos with just your words

Prompt: "This photo is boring and flat. Enhance it! Increase contrast, boost color, make it richer."

6. Old Photo Restoration

Just a simple prompt is needed: ‚Äúrestore and colorize this image.‚Äù

7.Visual Reasoning

Nano Banana is capable of understanding the logical information in our prompts, outperforming previous text-to-image models in this regard.

For example, it can accurately interpret what an overcooked pizza looks like, and even understand how a pizza would appear after being baked for two hours.

<img width="1080" height="706" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4807f13-95c1-4aa3-8ff4-fe5265c28270" />

8.Change Photo Perspective

Prompt: Change the perspective to a high angle, looking down from above, as if from the corner of the ceiling.

Not happy with the angle of your photo? Now you can use Nano Banana to directly change the perspective.

Of course, there are many more ways to use it ‚Äî this is just a starting point. Everyone is encouraged to experiment and explore their own creative ideas.

Nearly free

Google‚Äôs tech blog explained that while previous versions were fast, users have been asking for higher-quality images and greater control.

The new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is designed to meet the needs of these discerning users.

Not only is it available directly on Gemini and Google AI Studio, but the API pricing is unbelievably low ‚Äî just $0.039 per image, which is less than 0.3 RMB.

With the API, we can finally integrate Nano Banana into our own workflows.

Are you ready to roll up your sleeves and try this magical banana right now?

The most direct way is to visit Google AI Studio:

[aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Log in with your account, select the model, and you‚Äôre ready to start using it.

Even though it has officially launched, you can still go to LMArena (lmarena.ai) and experience Nano Banana in Image mode, pitting it against other models just like before‚Äîthough, unlike the official tool, it still requires ‚Äúdraws‚Äù to access.

Google is gradually rolling out this functionality on the web version of Gemini as well.

Having seen the rise and fall of many new tools, it‚Äôs rare to see one like Nano Banana: it arrives and immediately claims the throne, fundamentally solving core pain points.

In the past, tackling challenges in specific raw-image domains required specialized, fine-tuned smaller models.

Now, a giant like Google can simply leverage a powerful, general-purpose model to handle these tasks effortlessly.

What once seemed like Google falling behind has now turned into them firmly taking the lead.Previously, it seemed like Google was falling behind, but now it has clearly surged ahead.

Time for practice 
Before the official launch of Nano Banana, its most popular use was generating highly realistic collectible figurine images. We introduced this a few days ago:

"Not Just Zhong Kui Figures! AI Image Generation Has Gone Wild ‚Äî The Mysterious New Model Nano Banana Goes Viral Even Before Release."

For today‚Äôs practical insight, we recommend the tutorial by @Fuxixidin:
‚ÄúGet Started in 3 Minutes! Google‚Äôs New Model Nano Banana Figurine Generation Tutorial.‚Äù

This guide uses step-by-step images and explanations to intuitively demonstrate how to generate figurine-style images and also explains the underlying prompt engineering techniques.
