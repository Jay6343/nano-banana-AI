This new model called [Nano Banana](https://nanobanana.co/) is blowing up, and Everyone around the world is losing it!

You told it to add the same dog food to the cart, and it 1:1 cloned a bag, tilted it a bit, and dropped it right there—crazy detailed, almost perfect.<img width="2910" height="1918" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210422_997" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7422a73-c74f-4fa5-8d69-9b455c87a222" />

I uploaded a photo of Michael Jackson and another person, told the AI to make a group shot, and it nailed them almost 1:1.<img width="1097" height="1280" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210436_428" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8462c1-3004-40d7-b7f8-2f761bb7983c" />

It’s not just for two-person shots— even when you put four objects together in one pic, the consistency is still super good.
Let it fix old photos – it boosts clarity and removes spots, but won’t mess with any details.<img width="2510" height="2160" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210449_947" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33cf82dd-6c90-44c8-bfdc-b7f6f3e4a335" />

**"[Nano Banana](https://www.youtube.com/@aitoolreview918) is currently one of the strongest models when it comes to character consistency—even outperforming GPT, Flux Kontext, and others. It was first spotted on LM Arena, a crowdsourced AI benchmark platform built by UC Berkeley in 2023.

Crowdsourced basically means giving tasks to a bunch of people online, letting everyone vote, and then the platform tallies the results to adjust model rankings over time.

You can check it out at lm.arena.ai
. Just click 'Battle' at the top, type in a prompt, upload a reference image, and you’ll get two anonymous outputs. Pick the one you think is better, and the results are revealed. Usually, outputs from a model called Nano Banana come out on top. That’s how it got noticed—its high win rate made it famous.

It hasn’t been officially released yet, but many people speculate it’s from Google, possibly part of the Gemini 3 series."**<img width="4480" height="2344" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210456_124" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f9ea251-ee46-4e9a-9f2b-8c54326ee425" />

This article sums up what people online have tried, plus my own experiments. Let’s see all the crazy ways you can play with it!

1. Turn a screen image into a figure + packaging box

Prompt: Turn this photo into a character figure. Place a box behind it with the character’s image printed on it, and a computer showing the Blender modeling process on its screen. In front of the box, put a round plastic base with the figure standing on it. Try to set the scene indoors if possible.

The tricky part is the base image you give it. If your reference has a background, Nano might struggle to extract the character. But if you give it a plain white background, it’ll be much clearer which subject you want it to turn into a figure.<img width="3024" height="930" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210511_507" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ee5168-ef0e-465d-bceb-c269e65bf6fd" /><img width="3006" height="924" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210521_092" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bfc7d1b-8424-4aa3-b5c3-4050354ae76f" />


2.A pic of the two of us

I uploaded photos of me and Jackson Wang. Even though the people in the output don’t really look like us, the outfits are super accurate – they even got the LV logo on Jackson’s clothes perfectly!<img width="2046" height="1344" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210527_668" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19f597bb-e818-4bad-b371-c7e2b772b370" />

3. Understanding 3D Space

It adds a 3D mesh onto the character, accurately following the folds and details of the clothing.

Prompt: Draw a cyan wireframe mesh inside the silhouette, showing the 3D shape of what you see on the figure.<img width="2018" height="2164" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210533_421" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d023ac4c-b8c4-466b-99ef-cf15e592b290" />

4. Image Repair & Coloring"

You can fix blurry or damaged old photos, remove creases and missing details, and add accurate colors — the results are amazing.

Prompt idea:
"Turn this black and white image into a colorful one"<img width="2022" height="1968" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210544_382" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0f7e461-1632-4d66-bce8-5eba0c2db8b8" />

5. Scene Combos
You can combine multiple separate images, like Cook holding an iPhone 17 Pro.<img width="952" height="2136" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210549_038" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f226fbb-b63c-4e26-b328-0b62b7effe8c" />

6. Swap image elements

For example, replace Batman in the image with Superman, while keeping everything else exactly the same—like the cat in the picture—so the character consistency stays super strong.<img width="1972" height="1996" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210557_269" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93b95ccd-b734-49f4-b5a6-7dd550a261a1" />

7. Add outfits to characters

For example, put a baseball cap on the lady in the picture – the hat looks almost exactly like the real thing!<img width="2022" height="1158" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210603_220" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec974629-8ef1-45a6-bd37-fba177ac354b" />

8. Object Placement & Rearranging
You can straighten upside-down books and put them back on the shelf, though sometimes the text might get a little blurry.<img width="2030" height="1074" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210608_558" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/560f3a06-074e-4524-9458-498f1ac694e6" />

9. Product Placement
You can drop products like beer bottles, chairs, or lamps into existing images. It doesn’t just place them perfectly—it can even mimic shadows, like a lamp pattern cast on the floor. Super realistic!<img width="1087" height="1280" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210613_590" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1d98cbb-d3ed-41cd-917c-51aece27e576" />

10.Model holding the product
Upload a product on a white background and a model photo.
Type the prompt: 'the short hair model is using this camera.'
The model will be shown holding the camera and taking photos – perfect as a lifestyle shot for your e-commerce site.<img width="2706" height="1746" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210631_042" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce69b375-a939-4eb2-808e-82dcecf2347e" />

11. Put a person in a new scene

Upload a photo of yourself and enter a prompt like:

“Make me an insanely detailed pic of this guy tripping and falling on the moon, hitting his helmet on a rock.”

Then it will place the person on the moon.<img width="2008" height="1308" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210748_797" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf6e81fe-0e41-4577-8174-7765fea6d431" />

12.Change the image style: turn a spooky, creepy pic into a bright, cheerful kids-show vibe, keeping the composition the same while adjusting the lighting<img width="1978" height="1266" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210806_020" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a5b6630-6f6f-4bdf-9629-14e459d6f792" />

13. Understanding Complex Intent & Reasoning

Even if the prompt is vague, it can reason and generate images that make sense. For example, if you say 'pizza in a 400°F oven for 2 hours', it’ll show a burnt pizza—not a regular one. It can even get the hidden meaning of 'slow-roast for 2 hours' and produce a perfectly cooked, delicious pizza.<img width="2020" height="1320" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210811_477" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b068218a-b44a-46d5-b01c-046651f68bc7" />

14.Style Copy: Using the reference image’s style, create a 4-panel sports montage that mimics the look. Make it realistic with blur and motion streak effects.<img width="747" height="1280" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210816_893" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8986d4e-c94f-4b91-b547-bc504be8ea28" />

15. Card Making
You can create custom Pokémon cards, complete with accurate fonts, icons, and layouts – though sometimes the text might bleed through a bit.<img width="1228" height="1278" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210821_204" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aff403fb-53be-4c8c-baf7-9f8de17b226a" />

16. Video Thumbnails
Just type a simple prompt like 'Make me a YouTube thumbnail of this guy in VR Minecraft.'
In under 30 seconds, you’ll get a thumbnail that looks like it was crafted in Photoshop. Just tweak it a bit, and it’s ready to use on Bilibili or YouTube<img width="1344" height="768" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210829_166" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/524b6d72-53fb-4b24-981a-5dcda317b4eb" />
<img width="3072" height="1782" alt="微信图片_2025-09-03_210824_645" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79b54f0-4746-41f6-8751-b11d11b15fce" />

That’s it for today, friends! If you’ve got any fun ways to play, drop them in the comments. See you next time!
