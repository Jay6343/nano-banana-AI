Today I’ll show you how to use the super-popular “Nano Banana” generation model for free, plus some fun and creative ways to play with it.

Model Overview

Google’s internal project Nano Banana (officially Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) is seriously impressive! Released on the 26th, it immediately grabbed attention and users are calling it “the highest-rated editing model in the world.”

What’s really amazing is its insane image consistency—it can keep a person’s features stable across different poses, lighting, and styles.<img width="1135" height="517" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_140753_227" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc48a6fe-976b-42ed-b5aa-09b4ac9ff675" />

Because it blows other models out of the water when it comes to character consistency and lighting, the figures it generates look so real you’d swear they were actual photos of collectibles—no wonder everyone’s excited to create and share their own!<img width="1140" height="510" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_140818_044" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cec3863c-9265-416e-8076-a71d315c24a7" />

There are quite a few ways to use “Nano Banana” for free now, but I’d definitely recommend Google AI Studio. Other methods sometimes give lower-quality images, and even Google’s own Gemini can throw errors occasionally.<img width="1132" height="335" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_140909_995" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b46e9ba5-94ff-42a3-ae55-076c42efa915" />

Head to the official site: https://aistudio.google.com

First, click on the model in the top-left corner, then type your prompt into the input box (we’ve already put together a list of prompts at the end of this post—just copy and paste them, they work super reliably!).

I’m a huge anime fan, and I used my favorite characters to create these figures—seriously, it gave me total freedom with my collectibles!<img width="1136" height="517" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_141212_147" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e41fe257-d833-4b3d-b966-186a8118b470" />

The amazing thing about this model is how insanely accurate it is—the character details are spot-on, and even if part of the image is missing, it can fill in the gaps perfectly. Seriously, it’s next-level!<img width="1138" height="517" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_141259_060" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5104c118-1b31-4a9e-bfe7-b8874931489f" />

Besides creating figurines, there are tons of other ways to play around with it.

For example, outfits! Some users even combined 13 images into a single one.<img width="1139" height="521" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_141412_915" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcd0de01-9106-4751-bb75-8dfe92e92954" />

There are so many ways to play with it, and it’s still in testing—more features and tips will be shared soon!

Prompts we put to the test

Use the nano-banana model to create a 1/7 scale commercialized figure of the character in the illustration, in a realistic style and environment. Place the figure on a computer desk, using a circular transparent acrylic base without any text. On the computer screen, display the ZBrush modeling process of the figure. Next to the computer screen, place a BANDAI-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork.Masterpiece, best quality, photorealistic.
