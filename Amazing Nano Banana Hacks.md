2.Generate and edit multiple images

Generate multiple actions in one go to check content continuity. Prompt: On a single image, create four variations based on my original image showing these actions: 1) standing by the desk, 2) sitting and flipping through a book, 3) reaching out the window, 4) leaving the desk — arranged in a 4-grid layout.<img width="652" height="312" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161039_477" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e285b7-9b9f-4179-b7a4-8862c05d27f4" />

3.Multi-Image Blending & Remixing

Group Photo Generation:

The main test was to pick certain people from a group photo and merge them into a new group shot while keeping each person's features. Prompt: “Have the two kids in the front row take a photo together and swap in a clean, solid-color background.” You can really see how well it follows the instructions.<img width="651" height="313" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161111_341" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e00d1b3d-fd3b-4c2b-bed0-ef0e565df0b0" />

pattern transfer

You can take a design and apply it onto an object in another image. For example, you could upload a pattern and a photo of a plain white T-shirt, and have the pattern printed right onto the T-shirt.<img width="651" height="196" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161139_815" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad62b174-867e-40b4-b97e-92c634ee1691" />

Merging people into the scene

We want to combine two different people into a single image, making sure the lighting matches and their poses look natural. We can upload two photos of different people and prompt them to take a selfie in a café.

Prompt idea: “Have the two people from Image 1 and Image 2 take a photo together in a café, with natural lighting and a matching environment.”<img width="651" height="200" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161157_653" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/826385ef-fd2c-44fe-a8c8-9ca77b7d7af5" />

switch objects

Swap an object in an image with something else. For example, take a photo of a dog walking on the street and prompt it to replace the dog with a cat, keeping the same pose.<img width="652" height="412" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161216_182" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56dcf8ef-c7ae-4255-8717-41add25b9c10" />

4.Style transfer and special effects

Cartoonify

Turn a real photo into an anime or cartoon character. Upload a selfie and use the prompt: “Transform the person into a 2D cartoon style.”<img width="654" height="758" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161252_367" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16ea371f-cb65-455c-90e3-e4435bbc5c2f" />

Style Transfer

Generate new images in different styles based on a reference image. For example, a prompt could be: “Create a 4-panel montage showing sporting moments. Use the style of the reference image.”

Or, more casually:

"Take the style from this picture and make a 4-panel montage of sports moments in that vibe."<img width="649" height="196" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161311_805" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b5c6738-fbaf-44af-9060-f161d4bd856f" />

Turn your photo into a 3D model. Prompt: transform the person in the image into a 3D style.<img width="651" height="316" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161321_501" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e21b5675-e190-4220-ad76-87fd57324b8a" />

Restore old photos

You can use it to fix black-and-white or damaged old photos. Just upload the photo and use prompts like: “restore this old photo,” “colorize it,” “enhance to HD”.<img width="650" height="311" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161334_622" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc4031e9-c8fa-47ea-964b-3314373b4854" />

5.Changes in weather and time

Time shift

Keep the environment the same, but change the time. For example, upload an image and prompt: “Change the time in this image to nighttime.”<img width="653" height="472" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161343_989" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10343f97-dcdb-472a-8f34-0cb042dfd919" />

Change the weather

For example, turn a sunny day into a snowy or rainy one, and adjust reflections and lighting. Input a sunny photo and use this prompt: “Change the scene in this image to a snowy one, with snowflakes falling.”<img width="650" height="468" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161357_437" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31040b06-a87a-4b3a-9378-5f74f12f1ed7" />

6. Adding, Removing, and Editing Objects Locally
Removing Elements

Easily remove objects from your images without leaving any trace. For example, you could take a travel photo and prompt it to remove a passerby on the right side of the frame. Here, we’re showing some of the same sample images used in the previous article, now processed with Nano Banana.<img width="653" height="313" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161415_358" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e82152c-9fb8-440e-89b9-29f3efc1c7d3" />

Add an object

Add a new object while keeping the proportions natural. Here’s the photo: prompt — “Add a small kitten sitting next to the person, with proper proportions.”<img width="652" height="404" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161437_079" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74423740-fffa-4a19-afaa-a67812fe0042" />

Local edits

Change specific parts like eye color, hair, or accessories. You can upload a portrait and prompt it to, for example, turn the hair pink and add a metal earring. Or you can upload the image below and prompt: replace the badminton with a soccer ball.<img width="652" height="430" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161451_526" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5174371a-864f-4375-bd11-62a5d8800e15" />

Material/Texture Swap

Replace the surface material of an object with a different texture. Example prompt (casual English):
"Wrap all four legs of the chair in the image with a cozy cashmere material, making it blend naturally."<img width="653" height="315" alt="wechat_2025-09-02_161520_133" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9e442b-f33f-4676-8a9d-020caa39881d" />

7. Text and Symbol Editing – Changing Text Content

Modify the text on posters or signboards.

Example: Input an English poster (previously provided by Flux) and use the following prompt:

"Replace the English text at the top of the image, 'Flux PRO ULTRA,' entirely with 'Gemini Nano Banana.' Ensure the layout is balanced and the style remains consistent with the original."

Font change

Keep the layout but swap the font. Prompt: Change the English text at the top of the image to a printed/serif style, keeping it well-aligned.

Finally, after a long process—from gathering creative examples to conducting detailed evaluations across various types—we’ve completed it. The model’s outputs are extremely powerful, and it really takes creativity to explore and uncover its full potential!
